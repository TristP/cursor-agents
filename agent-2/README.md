# Agent 2 Project

This is a workspace for Agent 2.

## Getting Started

Add your project files here. This agent can work independently on this directory.

## Structure

Organize your files however makes sense for your project:
- `src/` - Source code
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `data/` - Data files

## Dependencies

Add a `requirements.txt` (Python) or `package.json` (Node.js) as needed.
